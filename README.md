# FAFO-BOA Sales Pipeline CRM

## Project Overview
PipelineIQ is a streamlined, visual CRM and pipeline management platform built for small and mid-sized sales teams (5-50 reps). The product prioritizes simplicity, speed, and visual clarity over feature complexity. It replaces bloated enterprise CRMs by delivering focused functionality: intuitive pipeline visualization (Kanban boards), deal tracking with customizable stages, real-time activity logging, basic forecasting, and team collaboration features. The platform is cloud-based, mobile-responsive, and designed for rapid onboarding (days, not weeks). Success is measured by user adoption rates, time-to-first-deal-logged, and customer retention.

## Core Functionality
1. **Visual Pipeline Board**: Drag-and-drop Kanban interface showing deals organized by customizable pipeline stages; real-time updates across team
2. **Deal Management**: Create, edit, and track deals with essential fields (prospect name, company, deal value, stage, close date, owner); custom field support
3. **Activity Tracking**: Log calls, emails, meetings, and notes directly from the pipeline; automatic timestamp and user attribution
4. **Contact Management**: Lightweight contact database with company associations, deal history, and communication history
5. **Pipeline Forecasting**: Simple revenue forecasting based on deal value, probability, and close date; weekly/monthly projections
6. **Team Collaboration**: Assign deals, @mention teammates, add internal notes, and view activity feeds
7. **Mobile Access**: Fully functional mobile app for deal updates and activity logging on the go
8. **Basic Reporting**: Pre-built dashboards showing pipeline health, win rates, average deal size, and sales cycle length

## User Journey
**Onboarding**: New user signs up, completes 5-minute setup wizard (company name, team size, sales process), and is guided to create their first 3 deals. System provides template pipeline stages (Prospect, Qualified, Proposal, Negotiation, Won/Lost) with option to customize.

**Daily Usage**: Sales rep logs in, views their pipeline board, updates deal stages by dragging cards, logs a call/email activity, and checks notifications for team mentions. Manager logs in, reviews team pipeline health dashboard, identifies at-risk deals, and sends coaching notes to reps.

**Weekly Workflow**: Manager runs forecast report, identifies pipeline gaps, and shares insights with team. Reps review their activity metrics and update deal probabilities.

**Monthly Review**: Team reviews win/loss analysis, pipeline velocity, and adjusts sales process if needed.

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture**: SaaS cloud platform (AWS/GCP), microservices-based backend, React/Vue frontend
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data (deals, contacts, activities); Redis for real-time updates and caching
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0, SSO support (Google, Microsoft), role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Rep)
- **Performance**: Page load <2 seconds, real-time updates <500ms latency, support 10,000+ concurrent users
- **Security**: AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, SOC 2 Type II compliance, GDPR/CCPA ready
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling infrastructure, CDN for static assets, ability to handle 100x user growth
- **Browser Support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest 2 versions); mobile iOS/Android via native apps
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

## API Integrations
1. **Email Integration**: Gmail and Outlook calendar sync; automatic meeting logging
2. **Communication**: Slack notifications for deal updates, @mentions, and pipeline alerts
3. **Payment Processing**: Stripe for subscription management
4. **Analytics**: Segment for product analytics and user behavior tracking
5. **Webhooks**: Outbound webhooks for third-party integrations (Zapier, Make, custom apps)
6. **Future Integrations**: HubSpot migration tool, Salesforce data import, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero)

## Real-Time Features
- **Live Pipeline Updates**: When one user moves a deal, all team members see the change instantly
- **Activity Feed**: Real-time notifications when teammates log activities, update deals, or mention you
- **Presence Indicators**: Show which team members are currently online
- **Collaborative Editing**: Multiple users can view and update the same deal simultaneously without conflicts
- **Push Notifications**: Mobile alerts for important deal changes and @mentions
- **Live Forecasting**: Pipeline forecast updates in real-time as deals progress

## Implementation Details

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)**: Activity logging system, email/calendar integration, real-time WebSocket implementation, mobile-responsive design, basic forecasting engine.

**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12)**: Mobile app development (iOS/Android), Slack integration, reporting dashboard, user testing and bug fixes, security hardening.

**Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16)**: Performance optimization, documentation, customer support setup, beta launch with 50 pilot customers, feedback iteration.

## User Experience Guidelines
- **Simplicity First**: Every feature must justify its existence; if it's not in the top 20% of use cases, it doesn't ship
- **Visual Clarity**: Use color, icons, and whitespace to make information scannable; avoid information overload
- **Speed**: All interactions should feel instant; loading states should be minimal and clear
- **Mobile-First Thinking**: Design for mobile constraints first, then enhance for desktop
- **Onboarding**: New users should log their first deal within 5 minutes; provide contextual help, not lengthy tutorials
- **Consistency**: Use consistent patterns for similar actions (e.g., all modals follow the same structure)
- **Feedback**: Provide immediate visual feedback for all user actions (success messages, error alerts, loading indicators)
- **Accessibility**: Ensure keyboard navigation, sufficient color contrast, and screen reader compatibility
- **Customization**: Allow teams to customize pipeline stages and deal fields without coding
- **Notifications**: Be respectful with notifications; avoid alert fatigue; let users control notification preferences
